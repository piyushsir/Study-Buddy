[["0",{"pageContent":"okay today I'm going to talk about howto succeed with a startup obviously morethan can be said here in 20 minutes butI will do the best I can the mostimportant thing the number one lesson wetry to teach startups is that the degreeto which you're successful approximatesthe degree to which you build a productthat is so good people spontaneouslytell their friends about it startupsalways ask us for the secret to successthey always want to believe it'ssomething other than this because thisis really hard to do but this is it ifyou can build a product that is so goodpeople spontaneously tell their friendsabout it you have done 80% of the workthat you need to be a really successfulstartup if you think about the mostsuccessful companies you know GoogleFacebook whatever you probably found outabout them because a friend of yourssaid you got to try this it's great sothis is the bar something that peoplelove so much they tell their friendsabout itone important indicator for a productlike that is a product it's simple toexplain and easy to understand if youcan't explain in a few words what you doand if people don't if at least somepeople don't say oh that's prettyinterestingthat's usually a mistake it's usually asign of unclear thinking or a need thatis not big enoughanother thing that startups need to lookfor is a market that is either startedto undergo or is soon going to undergrow exponential growth I think this isactually related to one of the biggestmistakes investors make when evaluatingstartups investors always say wellwhat's your growth rate we care aboutthe growth rate investors will forgivesmallish revenue today if it's growingquickly for some reason people don'tthink about markets this way but if youthink about the most important startupsthey are the ones that I start in smallmarkets that are growing very veryquickly 11 years ago the market foriPhone apps is zero dollars it's nothuge and I think if you only think aboutthe TAM today you'll make a big mistakewhat you really want to do is identify amarket that's going to grow every yearand be able to ride that up elevator areally important thing to figurefiguring this out is learning how todifferentiate between real trends andfake trends a real trend is somethingthat's actually going to happen in thefake trend is not or at least not yetand beforeyou make a big bet on a new platform youwant to make sure it's real now there'san easy trick for this which I'll sharenow real trends are ones where a newtechnology platform comes along and theearly adopters use it obsessively andtell the friends how much they love ita fake trend is one where people may buythe product but don't use it or at leastnot enough so an example of a real trendI already mentioned the iPhone I'llmention that again when the iPhone firstcame out many people were dismissivebecause they only sold a million or twomillion that year and they said wellthis just doesn't matter but for thepeople that had an iPhone they used itfor hours every day it became central totheir lives they loved it they toldtheir friends you've got to get one andI think it was obvious then do peoplepay an attention that something hadfundamentally shifted and we had a new anew computing platform that was gonnaspawn huge businesses and it was a goodtime to bet on mobile apps a fake trendor at least a fake trend as of august2018 I would say as VR I do believe VRwill be big someday but today mostpeople that I know that own a VR headsetuse it never or very rarely and soalthough a lot of people talk about itand maybe even a lot of people buy themthere's not the intense usage per useramong the early adopters that I thinkyou want to see before you make a bigbet another thing that startups need atleast one evangelical founder usuallythe CEO someone at the startup has gotto be the person that is going torecruit sell the product talk to thepressraise money and this requires someonewho can infect with enthusiasm the wholeworld about what the company is tryingto do and someone who becomes the chiefevangelist for the company it's veryhard to succeed wildly without that it'svery hard to build a team at all withoutbeing able to do that one thing thathelps for this is having an ambitiousvision you never want to be grandiosethat turns people off but you want tolet yourself grow more ambitious overtime and as long as you do thatorganically people will respondambitious visions are exciting they'refun to work on in fact I think in 2018at least in Silicon Valley it's easierto start a hardstartup than it is to start an easystartup now this sounds paradoxical butambitious projects are interesting youknow in the current environment it maybe relatively easy to raise capital butit's really hard to do everything elsethere are so many startups it's so easyto start one they all sound so promisingthat that bringing together enoughtalent in one organization is reallyhard to do and if you're working on aproblem that you know maybe modestlysuccessful it's it's kind of easy to getthe first two people to join you cangive them a lot of equity but then itgets really hard why is employee xxgonna join why is this why does thismatter to the world why should someonework on your startup versus any of theother things they could do and pickingsomething that matters if you'resuccessful is a great way to do that andso I think it's really important tothink about when you're starting acompany how is this going to evolve intoa vision that a lot of people want tohelp with but a lot of people want to beassociated with because I think gettingtalent and getting mindshare it isreally hard in the current environmentand people are interested in startupsthat matter another thing that we'venoticed among our best Saunders againand again and again is that they arehave a confident and definite view ofthe future they may be wrong and so wesay it's good to be confident andflexible but this idea that you areconfident in definite this is what Ithink is going to happen or this is whatis going to happen and being relativelysure of that having courage of yourconvictions being a clear leader sayingwe're gonna do this and that's why evenin the face of a lot of doubt that seemsto really correlate with success andthis comes back to having an ambitiousvision but the entire startup ecosystemis best set up to support companies thathave a low chance of success but arehuge if they work and I think going forsomething that is huge if it works willattract the best peoplenot going to talk too much about theteam there are a lot of obvious things Icould say that have been said many timesby many people about you know you needsmart people who want to work reallyhard and who communicate well these areall really true but I'd like to mentiona few non-obvious things that we'venoticed that we don't hear people say asmuch about the team you need to assemblethe note Khosla says that the team youbuild is the company you build and Ireally think that's true I've still metonly a handful of founders I think thatspend enough time on recruiting likeMark Zuckerberg is famously one of thembut building a great team I think otherthan picking the right market andbuilding a great product is the mostimportant thing you do all founders gothrough a transition all successfulfounders where you switch from buildinga product to building a company andbuilding a company really is about theteam so you need to mist the whole worldwill be telling you why you're gonnafail as a start-up if you don't havethat internal fire of belief if youdon't have people who say you know whatwe are gonna do this and it doesn'tmatter what the haters say we're gonnafigure this out and there is you knowthis problem it must be solvable if youdon't have the spirit of optimism on theteam it's very hard to succeed when theworld continues to punch you in the faceyou need at least some idea generatorsthere are a handful of people in anycompany that has gone on to be reallysuccessful that I that I've been able towork with who are just really good atcoming up with lots of ideas you don'ttoo many these people because that'smore ideas than a company can followthrough on but having some people withina company that are just constantlythrowing out new ideas most of whichwill be bad it turns out to be superimportant to have on the team thisspirit of we'll figure it out is myfavorite thing to hear among earlystartup team members a lot of things gowrong the situations that startups winin tend to be incredibly dynamic and sothis idea that even if I'm not qualifiedon paper even if I haven't solved thisproblem before even if this problemfeels like it's gonna kill the companywhich many problems will feel that waythis spirit among the team of you knowwhat we've got thepeople we need we're gonna figure thisout we're gonna get this done that'ssuper important another thing that Ilove to hear from early team members isI've got it so you know you hear in bigcompanies a lot of people say that's notmy department someone else is gonna dothat yeah or you know who this is reallybad this is gonna hurt us and you wantpeople who just step up and say I'll doit I've got it don't worry about it youwant people to have a bias towardsaction startups especially in theirearly days often win by moving veryquickly you never get as much data asyou'd like you never have as much timeto deliberate as you'd like and you wantpeople who will are willing to act withmuch less data than they'd like to havewith much less certainty and then ifthey act then it doesn't work they adaptreally quickly and try something else wetalk also about the blessing ofinexperience we have seen many of ourstartups do incredible things because noone told them it was hard no one toldthem they can't do it um there's a greatquote from Steve Wozniak about how allthe best things he ever did came fromhaving no experience whatsoever andhaving no money and you know thatobviously is not always true but thereis a magic thing that happens withstartups especially in their early daysbefore they've learned they're notsupposed to be able to do certain thingsand so I think as a start-up againdoesn't work to have everybody beingexperienced but you can take more betsthan you normally would on inexperiencedbut super high potential people that'sthe end of a topic on on team one of themost important jobs you have as afounder is to never lose momentum andthis is a little bit depressing becauseit means for the first few years younever get to take your foot off of thegas you never get to really rest we tryto be honest about this that startupsare not the best choice for work-lifebalance at all but especially in theearly days startups survive on their ownmomentum if you have momentum peoplekeep delivering results beyond what theythink they're capable of if you losemomentum it's very difficult to get itback and so continuing to make sure thatthe startup has a cadence that thestartup keeps winning on a relativelypredictively short and predictable andthis is really important and it's up tothe founders to make sure that that youdon't lose ahold of thisanother thing that we think startupsneed is a competitive advantage overtime now this is something that soundsso obvious I hesitated to even put it inthis is well discussed but we're seeingmore and more startups apply to YC andwhen we ask them so what is the longterm monopoly effect here what is thelong term competitive advantage what isyou know where is the network effect inthis business they look at us like it'sthe first time we've ever they've everheard this question all of the reallygreat businesses I know have an answerto this question and in fact the betterthey are the more they pretend not tobut this is something that you you wantto have a plan for another thing youwant to have a plan for is at least asensible business model you don't haveto have it all figured out at thebeginning but when we ask founders sohow are you ever going to make money andthey look at us like it's the first timethey've ever been asked that questionwhich happens more often than you wouldthink recently that's a bad sign tooagain this one is so common that Ihesitate to put it in herebut when we ask a start-up how they'regonna grow how they're gonna get usersand they look at us like it's the firsttime they've ever heard that questionbad sign so some sensible idea to tryhere firstPaul Buchheit once spent a bunch of timelooking one of the YC partners spent abunch of time looking at the traits ofour best founders and tried to distilldown what they were and he came up witha frugality focus obsession and loveI actually I think that is really good Idon't know how much to add but I thinkthese are things that you should be ableto say about what you're doing and youas a founder and finally I want to talkabout why startups get to be bigcompanies we've there are lots ofreasons I'm going to talk about a fewcommon ones here I think these trendsare valuable enough that as you evaluatestartup ideas you might do it's worththinking about if you fit into thesebecause it's really hard for startups tobeat big companies most of the time andhere are some areas where we see ithappening repeatedlyso I think one difference is if you area product manager at a big company andyou want to do something that soundssounds like a bad idea but is a goodidea you have to get everybody from yourboss sometimes all the way up to the CEOto say yes so one no can kill you ifyou're a start-up you can go to I seedemo day any number of the thousands ofinvestors can say yes and you get tohave a crack at it so it's a verydifferent mindset and for those ideasthat sound bad but are good because ofthis phenomenon this one no versus oneyes startups can win in fact startupsusually do beat big companies in thatcategory of ideas so look look for ideasthat sound bad but are good and whereyou are much more likely to get one yesthen someone in a big company is to getall yeses another area where startupsusually be big companies aren't veryfast changing markets startups greatspeed great advantage is an agility andspeed the more a market is changing thehigher the number of decisions you getto make and the higher number of tweaksto your product and your strategy youget to make and you want to optimize thenumber of those decisions that someonehas to make to compete with you becausea big company will make them on averageworse than certainly much slower thanyou do so the speed of market evolutiongives you a lot more chances to compoundyour advantage over a big company andthen finally startups usually win on bigplatform shifts many people haveobserved that startups companiesclusters those clusters usually comeafter a big platform shift we'll stickwith the iPhone example here aftermobile apps became a thing many newcompanies got started that are now quitevaluable and one of the reasons here isyou know most large companies work onsort of an annual cadence at least andwhen there's a huge platform shift theyare not good at making a big enoughstrategic pivot the Battleship justturns too slowly whereas a start-up cansay wow woke up this morning the worldis fundamentally different than it wassix months ago we're gonna go all in onthis new direction and so that's a waythat startups usually win or that that'san area where startups usually win therethere are many others but thinking aboutthese three I think is is directionallya good thing to do alright that's allI've got for today Jeff thank you verymuch for having me and for the classyou"}]]
